# Local-Hospital-Analytics
This repository contains the files for a data analytics project focused on improving operational efficiency in Nigerian hospitals.
# Project Overview
This project aims to build an interactive analytics dashboard that helps hospital administrators track patient flow, wait times, and resource utilization. By providing clear, data-driven insights, the dashboard identifies operational bottlenecks and supports informed decision-making to enhance efficiency within the hospital system.
# Problem
Many hospitals in Nigeria face challenges with patient overcrowding, long wait times, and inefficient resource allocation, leading to suboptimal patient care and increased operational costs. This project addresses these issues by providing a tool to visualize key operational metrics, enabling administrators to pinpoint problem areas and implement targeted improvements.
# Key Features & Insights
The dashboard focuses on tracking and visualizing the following critical areas:
/h1 Patient Flow & Volume h1/
Daily, weekly, and monthly patient admission trends.
Distribution of admissions by department and admission type (e.g., Emergency, Elective).
Analysis of patient length of stay.
## Wait Time Analysis:
Average patient wait times by department and admission type.
Identification of peak wait times and potential bottlenecks.
## Resource Utilization:
Doctor-to-patient ratios and individual doctor workload.
Departmental and diagnosis-specific resource consumption (using a proxy score).
